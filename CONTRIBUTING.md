## Quick TL;DR

- Make changes and tests if you can  
- Open a PR(Pull Request) with a clear description and steps to test 
- Donâ€™t commit secrets or files containing information such as `__pycache__` or `shorts_ai_data.json`
- Provide information about the system it was tested on

## Before you start
1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.  
2. Create a branch:
   - Feature: `feat/your-feature`
   - Bugfix: `fix/short-desc`
   - Docs: `docs/short-desc`
3. Run the app locally to test your changes. `start_app.py` handles installing missing dependencies
