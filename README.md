# YouTube-Shorts-Algorithm-Scroller
Extenion, algorithm, learning, free to use, easy to setup
---
An algorithm that can learn from the YouTube Shorts that you watch to automatically scroll and like/dislike videos for you.

**Note:** all code files were generated using Manus AI.

This is a side project that became useful enough I thought I'd share it with everyone.

I am **NOT** making any money off of this project.

This was only tested on Windows 11; it may not work with all systems.

# How to install and run locally

1. Install Python from https://www.python.org.  
2. When installing Python make sure to click **"Add Python to PATH"**.  
3. Download the `.zip` file and unzip it.  
4. Go to your browser's extensions page.  
5. Enable Developer mode.  
6. Select **"Open unpacked"** and select the downloaded and unzipped folder and make sure it's active/on.  
7. Open the unzipped folder and double-click `start_app.py` — this will download any dependencies that haven't already been installed and will run the app.  
8. Open https://www.youtube.com and navigate to the **Shorts** tab.  
9. You should see, in the bottom-left, a mood dropdown and other information; on the middle-right you can click **"Trust"** to make sure it doesn't dislike videos from the creator of the video you're currently watching.
10. Make sure every time you use it you start the backend part by starting `start_app.py`.

# Commands: 

Alt+T: Toggle control panel

Alt+S: Force scroll to next video

Alt+C: Force channel detection

It may take a bit before you start to see the algorithm scrolling and liking/disliking videos for you. I recommend about **3–5 hours** of scrolling before you start to see good results.

You can always override its decisions such as scrolling, liking, and disliking, and it will learn from that.

**Note:** Do not reload the extension after using it because it may fail once it has created the `_pycache_` directory. If you accidentally reload it, you can move `shorts_ai_data.json` and the `_pycache_` folder to another folder, reload the extension, then place them back in.

I do hope to somehow bring this to mobile, but it may be hard to do - I'm not sure how I'd attempt it and it won't be for a while.
